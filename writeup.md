# Homework 6: Data Visualization!

## (80 points) Visualization Scenarios

### Stage 1: Data Visualization in Data Exploration (30 points)

0. **Sample Aspect - Delete this**:
    - **Sample Question**: I want to analyze the relationship between stonks and reverse stonks.
    - **Graph & Analysis**: *Sample response - delete this*
        Here is my first graph to answer my question:
        ![two separate graphs of stonks and reverse stonks (this is my alt text)](graphs/sample_graph.png)

        In this graph, we see that stonks and reverse stonks can happen at the same time. Indeed, it can even
        happen in the same graph!
        ![stonks in the same graph as reverse stonks (this is my alt text)](graphs/sample_graph1.png)

        It is really interesting how both stonks and reverse stonks lines have their ups and downs kinds of moments. Here, we see that there might be a direct negative relationship between the *stonks* line and the *reverse stonks* line - they are different by a factor of `-1`. Therefore, we can conclude that stonks can happen in both directions.
